Supplemental documentation update of Pannellum for Panoscan

In addition to the values for "type" of  equirectangular, cubemap, or multires, we now have cylindrical and photo.

Cylindrical photos wil be partial panos and should have appropriate values for "haov" and "vaov".
For panoramas made on iPhone to its greatest extent these will typically be "haov": 284.9, "vaov": 65.0

Images of type photo will be presented without any 3d projection. The value hfov currently must be set to 100.0.
Appropriate values for minYaw and maxYaw can be set to -55.0 and 55.0 respectively to prevent the image from scrolling off screen. minPitch and MaxPitch will depend on the aspect ratio of the image.
